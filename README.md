# Go-compiler

This repository contains the source code of my project for the module Programming languages and compilers ([_Langages de programmation et compilation_](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ens/compil/)) given by Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre in Autumn 2019.
The goal was to develop a compiler for a fragment of the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). The grammar and typing rules are [here](description.pdf) (in French).
